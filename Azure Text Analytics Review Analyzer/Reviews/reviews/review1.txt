At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like "this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon." And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.

I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.

The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.

Overall, I didn't care too much for it.
